    In order to process your continuous integration server's build reports,
    you must provide Build Watch with the URL of your server dashboard's
    RSS feed.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> RSS URLs are case-sensitive and should begin with the
    protocol, such as "http://".
    </p>

    <h3>CruiseControl.rb</h3>
    <p>
    You can find the URL of your dashboard's RSS feed by clicking on the RSS
    icon in your browser's location bar. The URL should end in "projects.rss".
    For example:
    </p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com/projects.rss</p>

    <h3>CruiseControl.NET</h3>
    <p>
    The URL of your dashboard's RSS feed is not visibly displayed through
    the web interface. However, you can create it by replacing
    "ViewFarmReport.aspx" in your dashboard's URL with "XmlServerReport.aspx".
    </p>
    <p>For example, if your dashboard's URL is:</p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com/ViewFarmReport.aspx</p>
    <p>then the RSS feed's URL will be:</p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com/XmlServerReport.aspx</p>
    <p>
    You can confirm this by entering the URL in your web browser before
    trying to add it to Build Watch.
    </p>

    <h3>CruiseControl for Java</h3>
    <p>
    CruiseControl for Java provides a number of RSS feeds. Build Watch
    needs to be supplied with the feed that's compatible with CCTray. The
    link for this feed is labeled "CCtray" and is listed on the right side of
    the CruiseControl dashboard, in the "Tools" section. The URL will end in
    "cctray.xml". For example:
    </p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com/dashboard/cctray.xml</p>
    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> CruiseControl servers have two dashboards. Make sure you're
    looking at the dashboard with the word "dashboard" in the URL, as in the
    example above.
    </p>

    <h3>Hudson</h3>
    <p>
    Hudson provides a number of RSS feeds. Build Watch needs to be supplied
    with the feed that's compatible with CCTray. This URL is simply your
    server's dashboard URL with "cc.xml" appended to the end. For example,
    if your Hudson server's dashboard URL is:
    </p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com:8080</p>
    <p>
    Then the RSS feed you should provide to Build Watch will be:
    </p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com:8080/cc.xml</p>
</body>
