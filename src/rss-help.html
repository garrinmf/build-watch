    In order to process your CruiseControl server's build reports, you must
    provide Build Watch with the URL of your server dashboard's RSS feed.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> RSS URLs are case-sensitive.
    </p>

    <h3>CruiseControl.rb</h3>
    <p>
    You can find the URL of your dashboard's RSS feed by clicking on the RSS
    icon in your browser's location bar. The URL should end in "projects.rss".
    For example:
    </p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com/projects.rss</p>

    <h3>CruiseControl.NET</h3>
    <p>
    The URL of your dashboard's RSS feed is not visibly displayed through
    the web interface. However, you can create it by replacing
    "ViewFarmReport.aspx" in your dashboard's URL with "XmlServerReport.aspx".
    </p>
    <p>For example, if your dashboard's URL is:</p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com/ViewFarmReport.aspx</p>
    <p>then the RSS feed's URL will be:</p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com/XmlServerReport.aspx</p>
    <p>You can confirm this by typing the URL into your web browser.</p>

    <h3>CruiseControl for Java</h3>
    <p>
    CruiseControl for Java provides a number of RSS feeds. Build Watch
    needs to be supplied with the feed that's compatible with CCTray. The
    link for this feed is listed on the right of the CruiseControl
    dashboard, in the "Tools" section. The URL will look like:
    </p>
    <p class="example">http://builder.com/dashboard/cctray.xml</p>
</body>
</html>
